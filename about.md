The [Open Integrity Initiative](https://openintegrity.org) aims to raise the quality of software in order to improve application security and end user privacy.

It does so by curating and disseminating knowledge about software. It aggregates, synthesises and makes accessible information that covers different range of practices which impact userâ€™s security and privacy, for instance by conveying the important aspects of security audits, usability reviews or terms of services.

It will support an ongoing consultation feeding into a framework for the measurement of software project practices. It will leverage existing partnerships and developing new ones to drive the development and deployment of automated measurement and peer-review workflows. It will aggregate these measurements, categorise them within an open metric taxonomy and make them available through an open data repository. 

These curated metrics will become a source of ground truth, and enable the development of evidence-backed scorecards which can support software users, trainers, advocates, funders and policy makers in their efforts to improve end-user security and privacy. By focusing on the impact on at risk groups, it will provide better decision support for those who need it most, but in fact also impact a much broader global and growing audience of software users.

In the first phase of the project we will focus on creating a minimum viable platform openly, sharing both our practices and outputs for comment and review by the community using tools that enable free, open and asynchronous contribution. At the end of this phase, we will be able to assess the success of the approach, better evaluate its future impact and solicit additional funding sources.

### Funding

#### *April 2013* Information Security Coalition Small Grant

The project received a 74.5KUSD grant from the Information Security Coalition (administered by Counterpart International, itself funded by USAID). The project ran between April 1st and August 31st. The full proposal is publicly available on the wiki as well as the workplan and many details about how the project was run. The budget for the proposal is also visible. At the end of this grant, the current beta website was put online. We however decided not to launch publicly until we had received new funding, which could support our capacity to organise the collection of data, engage with potential reviewers and represent the open integrity index publicly.

#### *April 2016* New Venture Fund

The project receives a $104,500 grant from the New Venture Fund to reboot the Open Integrity Initiative focusing on the project team, project infrastructure, partner engagement and partnership agreements as well as establishing a platform for open and transparent collaboration. This grant will also support the Framework Phase, consisting of the development of the methodological foundations for the project, setting out initial thoughts, understanding and conclusions for dissemination and review by the wider community.

#### *July 2016* Open Technology Fund

The Open Tech Fund has allocated funds to support the Data Phase of the project, during which we will collect and review existing expert information across multiple disciplines about current development practices. This data will cover a diverse range of tools and be kept up to date. It will provide an outlet for independent audits sourced by expert communities. A public website will be launced with initial set of data in order to solicit feedback from the community.
