# Data

Evidence data about elements could be reused by OII. Steps for this could be:
 - In the *Company*Outcome sheets
 - Under each colored group, for each question *Element #*
     + In the sources field, there is a *Element #:* prefix followed by a list of numbers, for each *Source #*
         * In the *Company*Sources sheet
             - the *Source #* column has the reference, and there is:
                 + Document title
                 + URL
                 + Date of document (often empty)
                 + Date accessed
     + In the comment field, there is a *Element #:* with information that explains the score.


Converting to OII:
 - *Element #* would be a **Claim** it is prefixed by a yes/no with some details. The original question is not in the spreadsheet but on the website for instance (https://rankingdigitalrights.org/index2015/indicators/c1/) and as Markdown (https://github.com/rankingdigitalrights/index2015/blob/stage/app/_indicators/c1.md)
