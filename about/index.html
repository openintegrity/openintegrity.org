<p>Open Integrity maintains a list of software projects and provides information about their focus on digital security and end user privacy. Partnerships drive the development of automated measurement and expert review workflows. These metrics are a source of ground truth upon which evidence-backed scorecards can be developed for use by trainers, advocates, funders and policy makers working to improve end-user security and privacy.</p>
<p>The aggregated information measures best practices adoption in practices such as security, usability and terms of services. These measurements are aggregated, categorized within an open metrics taxonomy and made publicly available through an open data repository.</p>
<p>Open Integrity is also an ongoing consultation on impact that reflects on the measurement of software project practices. By focusing on the impact of best practices, as they relate to at-risk groups, the Open Integrity Initiative will provide decision support for those who need it most, while also serving a growing audience of software users.</p>
<p>In the first phase of the project we focus on developing a minimum viable platform to seek feedback from the community. We want our process to be open and to enable ongoing interactions about our activities, methodologies and outputs.</p>
<p>At the end of this phase, we will be in a position to evaluate both the success of our approach and its potential impact while soliciting additional sources of funding.</p>

<h2 id="partners">Partners</h2>
<h3 id="funding-partners">Funding Partners</h3>
<h4 id="april-2013-information-security-coalition-small-grant"><em>April 2013</em> Information Security Coalition Small Grant</h4>
<p>The project received a $74,500 grant from the Information Security Coalition (administered by Counterpart International, itself funded by USAID) between April 1st and August 31st. The full proposal with budget and work plan can be downloaded <a href="#proposal.pdf">here</a>. At the end of this grant a beta website was put online at <a href="https://openintegrity.org">openintegrity.org</a>.<br />
We however decided not to launch publicly until we had received new funding, which could support our capacity to organize the collection of data, engage with potential reviewers and represent the open integrity index publicly.</p>
<h4 id="april-2016-media-democracy-fund"><em>April 2016</em> Media Democracy Fund</h4>
<p>The project receives a $104,500 grant from the Media Democracy Fund to boot the Open Integrity Initiative focusing on the project team, infrastructure and partnership agreements as well as establishing a platform for open and transparent collaboration. This grant will also support the Framework Phase, consisting of the development of the methodological foundations for the project, setting out initial thoughts, understanding and conclusions for dissemination and review by the wider community.</p>
<h4 id="july-2016-open-technology-fund"><em>July 2016</em> Open Technology Fund</h4>
<p>The Open Tech Fund has allocated funds to support the Data Phase of the project during which we will collect and review existing expert information across multiple disciplines about current development practices. This data will cover a range of tools and be kept up to date. It will provide an outlet for independent audits sourced by expert communities. A public website will be launched with an initial set of data in order to solicit feedback from the community.</p>
