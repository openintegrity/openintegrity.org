The [Open Integrity Initiative](https://openintegrity.org) is convening a broad selection of multidisciplinary experts and partners and moderating a transparent, open and quality debate around the methodological questions and key design elements of the Open Integrity Initiative.

Ongoing consultations and partnership will help answer these questions:

- How are end-users impacted by software practices in security and privacy, with a particular focus on vulnerable users.
- Which best practices impact end-users, which type of vulnerabilities and adversaries do they aim to mitigate for?
- Which metrics can be collected that will help measure software practices, i.e. which type of evidence can be collected in order to verify the adoption of best practices?
- How should the scoring be determined, i.e. in which way can the fulfilment of certain criteria be aggregated into a score which will reflect end-user concerns and risks?

### Impact Partners

> The **Impact Consultation** will focus on local organisations or intermediaries that are in contact and aware of real world impact and potential impact on users at risk.

Selected Impact Partners will help ensure that Open Integrity is aware and focused on how **end-users are impacted by software practices** in security and privacy, with a particular focus on vulnerable users.

### Measurement Partners

> The **Technology consultation** will convene computer security researchers, software and systems engineer, able to link technology best practices to impact and connect OII to existing industry standard frameworks.

Measurement Partners will contribute to and adopt a common metrics metadata format to help aggregate metrics according to a common taxonomy. Measurement partners will be chosen according to the following criteria:

- Use of free software or open source collector agents.
- Hosting and management of their own collection infrastructure.
- Publication of data with an open data licence.

Open Integrity Index will work together with Measurement Partners who are interested in extending their collector software capabilities and/or their collection infrastructure and aim to provide financial support for such projects. In particular Open Integrity Index will aim to support the development of metrics which cover the following range of concerns:

- Project level metrics and metadata.
- Package and Libraries metrics (for instance around dependencies)
- Infrastructure metrics
- Documentation metrics
- Localisation metrics
- Usability metrics
- User review metrics
- Legal metrics
- Human Rights Policies and Practices metrics (Ranking Digital Rights)
- Security audit metrics
- Net Neutrality
