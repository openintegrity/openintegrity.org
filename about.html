        <p>The <a href="https://openintegrity.org">Open Integrity Initiative</a> aims to raise the quality of software in order to improve application security and end user privacy.</p>

<p>It does so by curating and disseminating knowledge about software. It aggregates, synthesises and makes accessible information that covers a range of practices that impact the security and privacy of users by, for instance, conveying the important aspects of security audits, usability reviews and terms of services.</p>

<p>It supports an ongoing consultation that feeds into a framework for the measurement of software project practices. The initiative leverages existing partnerships and works to build new ones in order to drive the development and deployment of automated measurement and peer-review workflows. It aggregates these measurements, categorises them within an open metrics taxonomy and makes them available through an open data repository.</p>

<p>These curated metrics will become a source of ground truth upon which evidence-backed scorecards can be developed for use by trainers, advocates, funders and policy makers working to improve end-user security and privacy. By focusing on the impact of best practices, as they relate to at-risk groups, the Open Integrity Initiative will provide decision support for those who need it most, while also serving a growing audience of software users.</p>

<p>In the first phase of the project, we will focus on creating a minimum viable platform while seeking feedback from the community by sharing our activities, methodologies and outputs using tools that enable free, open and asynchronous contribution. At the end of this phase, we will be in a position to evaluate both the success of our approach and its potential impact while soliciting additional sources of funding.</p>

<h3 id="funding">Funding</h3>

<h4 id="april-2013-information-security-coalition-small-grant"><em>April 2013</em> Information Security Coalition Small Grant</h4>

<p>The project received a $74,500 grant from the Information Security Coalition (administered by Counterpart International, itself funded by USAID). The project ran between April 1st and August 31st. The full proposal is publicly available on the wiki as well as the workplan and many details about how the project was run. The budget for the proposal is also visible. At the end of this grant, the current beta website was put online. We however decided not to launch publicly until we had received new funding, which could support our capacity to organise the collection of data, engage with potential reviewers and represent the open integrity index publicly.</p>

<h4 id="april-2016-media-democracy-fund"><em>April 2016</em> Media Democracy Fund</h4>

<p>The project receives a $104,500 grant from the Media Democracy Fund to reboot the Open Integrity Initiative focusing on the project team, project infrastructure, partner engagement and partnership agreements as well as establishing a platform for open and transparent collaboration. This grant will also support the Framework Phase, consisting of the development of the methodological foundations for the project, setting out initial thoughts, understanding and conclusions for dissemination and review by the wider community.</p>

<h4 id="july-2016-open-technology-fund"><em>July 2016</em> Open Technology Fund</h4>

<p>The Open Tech Fund has allocated funds to support the Data Phase of the project, during which we will collect and review existing expert information across multiple disciplines about current development practices. This data will cover a diverse range of tools and be kept up to date. It will provide an outlet for independent audits sourced by expert communities. A public website will be launched with initial set of data in order to solicit feedback from the community.</p>
