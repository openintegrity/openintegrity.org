<ul>
<li>Data Consumer looks up Skype</li>
<li>They see a data point on 2FA availability which says that it is &quot;only available with a Microsoft account&quot;.</li>
<li>They see that the data point has been reviewed by a number of individuals/organisations the data consumer trusts.</li>
<li>They can click on a &quot;?&quot; icon to get more information about the context of this particular data point such as:</li>
<li>Measurement Metadata:
<ul>
<li>Source (which, which collection approach, verification approach,...)</li>
<li>Collection (date, collecting agent,...)</li>

<li>Metric Type: It could be that it's an expert review, a user review, has a screenshot or a web page capture as evidence, from one or many network vantage points - offering different correlation strength.</li>

<h4 id="review-triggers">Review Triggers</h4>
<p>A number of data related events could trigger the need for a review. Here are some example of event types (which could all be subscribed to independently, or by different groups of users)</p>
<ul>
<li>A new tool has been submitted</li>
<li>The underlying source has changed (like a watched web page) making a data point &quot;stale&quot;</li>
<li>A dispute occurs.</li>
<li>The overall coverage or freshness metrics are below a certain threshold.</li>
<li>A bounty is made available.</li>
</ul>
<p>There should be clear signage about:</p>
<ul>
<li>the type of expertise needed to contribute to this particular trigger</li>
<li>maybe the time it will take to contribute</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="browsing-reviewer">Browsing Reviewer</h4>
<p>They visit the site because they've heard about it and are curious. There should be a number of call for action on the page:</p>
<ul>
<li>a few &quot;Join&quot; or &quot;Contribute&quot; buttons leading to
<ul>
<li>The current [join](page</li>
</ul></li>
<li>stale/disputed/empty data points should be marked and have a call to action (including to put a bounty on something that someone would like)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="engaged-reviewer">Engaged Reviewer</h4>
<p>A user, another reviewer or the platform's social media feed create engagement with potential reviewers.</p>
<ul>
<li>They might receive a social media alert that a data point needs review on the platform.</li>
<li>They should land on a page which show the relevant data point and:
<ul>
<li>Describes the actions that need to be undertaken (allowing to click through to do the work)</li>
<li>Surface a few other potential tasks (allowing to engage others in their network that might want to help)</li>
<li>They might be able to &quot;Grab&quot; it - to show someone is working on it (possibly publicly)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Once they completed the task, they</li>

<li>a number of (one, batch of 5 or 10)</li>
<li>specific event type/review triggers</li>

#### Interested Person
> E.g. Board member candidate, potential reviewer, funder,...

Could see a Kanban view of the main components of the project with swimlanes as gitlab milestones (used as a layers because of the ongoing nature of the project)?

#### User Stories

> Should be a transcluded view of gitlab issues `: [](=issues tag:"stories")` 

As a researcher in the Impact Group I can add and tag my desk research on known incidents with a particular tool or within a particular community

As a member of the Impact Group who works closely with at-risk users, I have a place to record and tag anonymized digital security incidents and vulnerabilities as I learn about them, even if I do not have all of the details

As a security techie in the Impact Group, I can add technical clarification and link to related research after learning of a new incident or vulnerability that has been added to the platform but that lacks details

As a member of the Impact Group, I can link to and tag articles and reports that I think might be relevant to existing incidents or vulnerabilities on OII

As a member of the Impact Group, I can easily learn of new additions to the platform that are relevant to my expertise or to the communities with which I work

#### Approach

 - Iterate. It should be easy to draft content including folder structure, with loosely linked, sparse files.
 - Release early and often. There should be minimal barriers to releasing work in progress. 
 - Clear labeling. It should be easy for writers and readers to differentiate draft work from more mature work. A la commitizen/conventional-changelog.
 - Small repos. As in code, try to separate concerns of content repos.

> Problems to be mindful of:
>  - Divergence: lots of sparse, unconnected files. -> TOC/TOC Crosslinks
>  - Calcification: structures don't evolve because of the cost of refactoring repos/folder/files.
>  - 

#### Implementation

 - Draft/Published
 - Draft/Ready for Review/In Review/Reviewed/...
 - .../RTBC?

 - Are there private spaces for elaborating details with partners for instance?

 - Anonymous access / contributions
     + There doesn't seem to be the possibility to allow anonymous submission of issues. 
     + It might also be very susceptible to spam if it exists. So maybe creating a shared Guest account (guest/guest) would work. 
     + The password could be changed when there is too much abuse... 
     + Information should be provided about the Guest account (such as what's happening with the log data and other consultation metrics) 

##### Platform

Evaluation of assembl vs a content as code approach.

Key features:
 - For free (versioning, branches, pull requests)
 - Discussion (via code review / github's ?)
 - Harvesting/Synthesis
 - Traceability (via some form of validated semantic linking)

Nice to have
 - Personal annotations.

Managing comments in a code review tool:
 - pros: separation of concerns.
 - cons: comments are not in the markdown (so can't be checked out).
 - mitigation: output commented version (generate diffs, tooltips and medium style side comments). Roundtripping that would be hard (i.e. adding comments by committing changes to the markdown versions) but probably doable. We're back to using Markdown as a persistence format.
